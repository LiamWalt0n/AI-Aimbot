# Creating a New Conda Environment with Python 3.11

Follow these steps to create a new Conda environment with Python 3.11:

## Step 1: Open a Terminal

Open a terminal window. This could be Git Bash, Terminal on macOS, or Command Prompt on Windows.

## Step 2: Create a New Conda Environment

To create a new Conda environment with Python 3.11, use the following command:
```

```bash
conda create --name RootKit python=3.11
```

In this command, `RootKit` is the name of the new environment, and `python=3.11` specifies that we want Python 3.11 in this environment.

## Step 3: Activate the New Environment

After creating the new environment, you need to activate it using the following command:

```bash
conda activate RootKit
```

Now, `RootKit` is your active environment.

## Step 4: Verify Python Version

To verify that the correct version of Python is installed in your new environment, use the following command:

```bash
python --version
```

This should return `Python 3.11.x`.

That's it! You have successfully created a new Conda environment with Python 3.11.
