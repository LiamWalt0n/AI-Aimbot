# Cloning a GitHub Repository

Cloning a GitHub repository creates a local copy of the remote repo. This allows you to save all files from the repository on your local computer. Here's how you can do it:

## Step 1: Copy the Repository URL

Navigate to the main page of the repository on GitHub and click the "Code" button. Then click the "copy to clipboard" button to copy the repository URL.

## Step 2: Open a Terminal

Open a terminal window on your computer. If you're using Windows, you can use Git Bash or Command Prompt. On macOS, you can use the Terminal app.

## Step 3: Navigate to the Directory

Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the `cd` (change directory) command. For example:
```

```bash
cd /path/to/your/directory
```

## Step 4: Clone the Repository

Now, run the `git clone` command followed by the URL of the repository that you copied in step 1:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RootKit-Org/AI-Aimbot.git
```

Replace `https://github.com/RootKit-Org/AI-Aimbot.git` with the URL you copied.

## Step 5: Verify the Cloning Process

Navigate into the cloned repository and list its files to verify that the cloning process was successful:

```bash
cd AI-Aimbot
ls
```

Replace `AI-Aimbot` with the name of your repository if you called it something else. The `ls` command will list all the files in the directory.

That's it! You have successfully cloned a GitHub repository to your local machine.

By cloning the repo, any later changes you can git pull.
